# Attention-Mechanism
Implementing the General Attention Mechanism with NumPy and SciPy

The attention mechanism is a machine learning technique that was introduced to improve the performance of the encoder-decoder model for machine translation. The idea behind the attention mechanism is to permit the decoder to utilize the most relevant parts of the input sequence in a flexible manner, by a weighted combination of all the encoded input vectors, with the most relevant vectors being attributed the highest weights. The attention mechanism can be generalized for tasks where the information may not necessarily be related in a sequential fashion.

The attention mechanism is an Encoder-Decoder kind of neural network architecture that allows the model to focus on specific sections of the input while executing a task. It dynamically assigns weights to different elements in the input, indicating their relative importance or relevance.
